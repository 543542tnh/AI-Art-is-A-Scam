        <h2>How Does it Affect the Artist?</h2>
        <p> Here is a perfect case study to demonstrate how AI art affects the artist.

        <p> Genshin Impact artist, AT (@haruno_intro) had their artwork stolen during the live stream on Twitch by a
            viewer, musaish who screenshotted the incomplete artwork and had NovelAI to complete it. They uploaded it
            onto X shortly afterwards. Not only did the viewers dare to steal the artwork, but they also demanded the
            original artist AT who has by the time completed their artwork to credit their artwork, stating “they took
            the AI picture as a reference” and evidenced with a time-proof AI image (Levine, 2022).
        <p>
            Below is a comparison of AT’s original artwork and the stolen artwork.

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            Thankfully the viewer has been banned from X as a result however it brought up many concerns and worries
            from artists on X to the point, that they may not wish to post their sketches or incomplete artworks online
            in fear this incident might happen to them.
        <p>
            Below are screenshots of artists’ posts expressing their concerns and being outraged by the incident.

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th><img src="Image/genelJumalon twt.png" style="width:90%"></th>
                <th><img src="Image/RelusionH twt.png" style="width:90%"></th>
                <th><img src="Image/Solastico twt.png" style="width:110%"></th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td><i>Figure 21</i> @genelJumalon Post <br>(Source: Levine, 2022)</td>
                <td><i>Figure 22</i> @RelusionH Post <br>(Source: Levine, 2022)</td>
                <td><i>Figure 23</i> @Solastico_ Post <br>(Source: Levine, 2022)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            Along with worrying about thieves, there is a new type of commission scam circulating the community that has
            caused artists to lose a lot of money. The scam is where the thief commissions the artist for a sketch (or
            any at the lowest price). Once they received the completed sketch from the artist, they would then use AI to
            complete the sketch into a fully finished coloured artwork at a low price instead of paying it at a price
            they would pay the artist for fully coloured artwork (Duchess Celestia, 2023).

        <p> This further justifies the artist’s concerns for their future and brings more reasons to why AI art should
            be contained and strictly regulated as it deeply affects the artist and their life. it showed there are
            people with ill intentions to use the AI art generator to steal original artists’ artworks and their
            opportunities. Regardless the purpose of the AI art generator was innocent or not, some people take
            advantage of the technology and use it for ill intentions.
