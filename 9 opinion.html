        <h2>My Opinions</h2>
        <p>
            According to my observation, the intention behind of using an AI art generator is the issue. As I mentioned
            before, some people use AI art generators for entertainment which is not a problem as people are allowed to
            have enjoyment and likes to play mindless entertainment. Since it is similar to the customisable icon.
            However, many people use AI art to deceive their clients, believing they will receive an original artwork
            created by them, not an artwork generated through AI art which they could have done themselves for free.
            Furthermore, more often or not it is a stolen art as AI art generator ‘borrowed’ from original artists’
            artworks.
        
        <p>
            In my opinion, there should be a restriction on the use of AI. I agree AI is very useful as it is efficient
            and less time-consuming making the workplace much easier and accessible for anyone. However, it does not
            mean that AI should be placed in every industry especially in creative industries as there is a limit to
            what AI can do as evidenced by the cases I have shown.
        
        <p>
            The main purpose of AI should be to provide aid and lessen the workload for humans to work efficiently and
            effectively, not providing potential scams and increased stress and anxiety for people in creative
            industries who are potentially out of work due to AI overtaking their jobs.
