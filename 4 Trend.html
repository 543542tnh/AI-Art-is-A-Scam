            issues, ethical, and socio-political problems of AI science and industry” (Grba, 2022, p.4).

        <p>
            Look at the graph chart above, this graph indicates the web search trend of AI art on Google from 2018 to
            2023. From 18th November 2018, very few people have an interest in AI art to almost zero possibly due to
            none of the popular AI art generators being made yet, hence no one has the desire to search for AI art or is
            not known yet. Until 2020, when AI art becomes a trend thanks to DALL-E, who is the first AI art generator
            created that instantly becomes viral, causing many people to search and browse the world of AI art.

        <p>
            This graph chart demonstrates the interest over time for image search of “AI art.” Compared to the web
            search of “AI art”, there is a high inconsistency of interest from 2018 to 2020 until after November 2021,
            the interest begins to rise and continues to increase, indicating AI art is becoming a trend which makes
            users want to join in the trend. On May 14, 2023, there is a slight decrease which may imply there is a
            sudden loss of interest in AI art for possible reasons such as no new AI art posted.

        <p>
            Those graphs do not fully demonstrate the popularity of AI art as many people may use other words to search
            for AI art for example ‘AI art generator’ or common websites (e.g. Midjourney). I presents these graphs to
            show the strong influence AI art has that causes clients to bypass artists and
            designers, in favour of AI art generators or commission AI artists simply because they are in demand. Thus,
            making it extremely difficult for creative industry to make a living and slowly must resign..

        <p> Although some inspect the reason why AI art becomes viral it is because of the intrigue and unique features.
            However, other people have other theories as to why it has roots in the mainstream, it gives the internet
            user entertainment as many flash games and well-known websites (e.g. Club Penguin) are shut down, giving
            limited uses on the internet like social media (Karsten, 2005; OFcom, 2022; FunkyFrogBait, 2024).
