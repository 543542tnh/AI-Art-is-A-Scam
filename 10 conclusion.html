        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            In conclusion, AI perceives as a scam as it requires regulations and boundaries to be set for people to
            understand how to use AI to avoid conflict and issues. These issues lead to designers and clients scamming
            each other with stolen artworks and finance, to the point people have trust issues, unwilling to commission
            artists again.

        <p>
            Many people slowly start to fully understand and see the impact AI have on the creative industries and
            clients. They will likely be adamantly against AI and promote artists and designers to show their support to
            them. As well as artists and designers will slowly start to accept AI as part of the creative industry in
            how they will think of AI.
        <p>
            In the future, I believe AI art will slowly lose its popularity mainly because it cannot have copyright
            claims, making owners (or companies) unwilling to continue their business or use AI art generators as there
            is nothing to protect them from thievery. However, I do think AI will stay in the creative industries but as
            a tool, not as an outcome since it is useful and gives graphic designers more possibilities of what they
            could do. And just having the potential to become a powerful tool, many creative programs (notably Adobe)
            will start to have AI as a tool.
