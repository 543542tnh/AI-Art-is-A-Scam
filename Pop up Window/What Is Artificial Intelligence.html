        <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
        <p> To understand the content of artificial intelligence art, we would need to start from the basic, by asking
            ourselves what artificial intelligence is.

        <p> According to John McCarthy, AI (shorten for artificial intelligence) is “the science and engineering of
            making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of
            using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are
            biologically observable.” (IBM, no date, p. 1)

        <p> Machine learning is an algorithms-based AI program trained on the data. The data and experience that have
            been processed allowed the algorithms to identify patterns to predict and recommend to users. The efficacy
            of algorithms improved by adjusting themselves to new data and experience. As the technology significantly
            progressed, there is a massive volume and complication of data that is difficult for the humans to handle
            that increased potential and need of machine learning (Nichols, Herbert Chan and Baker, 2018; Janiesch,
            Zschech and Heinrich, 2021; IBM, no date).

        <p> There is a type of machine learning called ‘deep learning’ where it processed an expansive range of data
            resources (e.g. text) without a human’s assistance and can produce accurate results than old machine
            learning could do. It used neural networks to consume and process data many times to learn the complex
            details of data. It also can make deductions about the data to find out if it is correct, allowing them to
            make new deductions about the new data based on what they have learnt from the previous data.

        <p> Machine learning used three different types of neural networks that have own uses.

        <p> <b>Feed-Forward Neural Network </b> </p>
        <p>
            The first one is ‘feed-forward neural network’. It is a simple network as it only moved the information
            forward from input layer to output layer without. The process is quite straightforward as you place the data
            into the machine to train them to predict every possibility. It is often used in banking to detect frauds.

        <p> <b> Convolutional Neural Network </b> </p>
        Convolutional neural network (shorten as CNN) is a feed-forward neural network based on animal visual cortex
        (the image processer). It is well suitable for tasks related to identifying. It began with processing the
        provided image into a collection of pixels. It goes into the hidden layer to identify the unique feature of the
        image. After identifying every aspect of the image, CNN is now able to classify any other images same as the
        given image if it had the same features.
        <p> <b>Recurrent Neural Networks</b>
        <p> Artificial neural networks called Recurrent neural networks focused on connections where the machine would
            put the data into a loop forward and backwards as it goes through the layers. It is useful for predication
            as every input along with previous inputs that are automatically fed into the machine (McKinsey, 2023).

        <p> AI can be split into two groups: strong and weak. Weak is usually used for a simple task like being a
            personal assistant for example, Apple’s Siri who answered any questions. And strong AI can perform a
            complicated task like a human carrying the task as they are designed solve issue that may appear without a
            human’s assistance like self-driving cars (Investopedia, 2023).
            
        <p> The main purpose of AI art is to create a digital source to have easy access and collect all artworks
            (Cetinic and She, 2021). However, the purpose can vary depending on the creator. The most common purpose is
            growing the possibilities of technology and creativity as well as to persuade people to include technology
            as part of their live and creativity (Fotor, no date).
        
        <p> Those websites listed below are most popular AI generators that enabled you to produce AI art (although some
            may cost money to produce) (Zapier, no date).
