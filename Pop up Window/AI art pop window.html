        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p> In recent years artificial intelligence has become a key issue for the creative industry due to being seen
            as a threat to many designers and artists (Leslie, 2023).

        <p> Many sees artificial intelligence as beneficial as it is effective and can mass-produce high-quality
            creative content giving designers and artists an easier time to focus on their jobs (Paper Crane, no date).
            However, very few people realises the small extent of the ethical issues and the damaging effect on the
            creative industries with their jobs and lives. (Babbs, 2023).

        <p> I view artificial intelligence art as a scam because many people are blinded by the benefits, failing to see
            the ill intentions behind those artificial intelligence art generators and the potential damage they caused
            to them, and creative industries and it can go both sides. For example, designer uses artificial
            intelligence as an outcome, tricking the clients believing they receive an original art. Or the client uses
            artificial intelligence art generator to bypass artists and designers.

        <p> This essay will attempt to highlight how artificial intelligence is a threat to the creative industries and
            how acceptable it is to use artificial intelligence as a tool during the design process.

        <p> This essay will examine the definition of artificial intelligence and will show both sides of artificial
            intelligence art; benefits and drawbacks with case studies to show the points and potentials that could come
            out of artificial intelligence. In conclusion, it will aim to answer the biggest question, is artificial
            intelligence art truly a scam?
