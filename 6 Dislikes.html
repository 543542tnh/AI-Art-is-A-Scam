        <h2>Why Do People Dislikes AI Art?</h2>
        <p>
            Other than the ethical issues, some people may dislike the inorganic feeling behind AI art, as it is
            generated by a computer, not a human. Some people may prefer organic art pieces as they like to feel the
            ‘realness’ behind them since artists often pour their emotion into it compared to the computer (emotionless
            machine) which quickly produces the artwork in a few seconds (Leslie, 2023).

        <p>
            Based on my observation, some AI art generators may come with some different style options, although it is
            very limited and most of the options are very generic which they do not want. Not to mention, it is very
            difficult to get the exact piece you requested as it is produced through prompts which require hours of
            finding the correct words and browsing through the option to find the closest artwork you like the most. It
            is easier to find the exact artwork you want by requesting the artist as they can show the sketch and adjust
            it to your liking. Furthermore, you can communicate with the artist making it easy for you and the artist to
            know how the art piece will come out like.

        <p>
            I decided to experiment with two different AI art generators to understand why people prefer human artists
            to create artwork, not AI.


        <table>
            <tr>
                <th><img src="Image/happy dog normal style.png" style="width:60%"></th>
                <th><img src="Image/happy dog realistic style.png" style="width:60%"></th>
                <th><img src="Image/happy dog anime style.png" style="width:60%"></th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td><i>Figure 15</i> "A Happy Dog" Normal style <br>(Source: Stable Diffusion, 2023)</td>
                <td><i>Figure 16</i> "A Happy Dog" Realistic style <br>(Source: Stable Diffusion, 2023)</td>
                <td><i>Figure 17</i> "A Happy Dog" Anime style <br>(Source: Stable Diffusion, 2023)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p> Those are images I generated from Stablefusion, an AI generator program based on a prompt, “a happy dog” in
            three styles: normal, realistic and anime. Each style is noticeably different from the other however some
            parts of the dog looked unrealistic especially in “Normal” and “Realistic” styles. For example, the position
            of the dog collar is on the body area, not around the neck where it should be, making it seem like the
            collar is too big to fit around the dog’s neck. In the “Realistic” style, the details of the fur do not
            naturally flow well around the body the way the fur is supposed to and based on those minor details, the
            style has failed as the proportion and details are inaccurate which is the style of “realistic” about.

        <div style="text-align: center"><img src="Image/super mario and luigi.png">
            <div class="reference"> <i>Figure 18</i> Super Mario and Luigi (Source: AI Image Generator API, no date)
            </div>
        </div>

        <p> I experimented once again on a different AI art generator called HotPot using the well-known brothers Mario
            and Luigi from Nintendo as a prompt. This is an image I received from the generator based on the prompt
            provided to them and it already has a few issues immediately noticed. For example, in the centre, I was
            given Mario and Yoshi (the green dinosaur) instead of Luigi who has been placed as one of the background
            characters that is drawn very deformed. Furthermore, a few details of Mario are not concise like the back of
            Mario, there is an extra clothing and shape that seems part of the jumpsuit however it is unclear what it
            could be. Also, the detail of Mario’s hand is inaccurate as he used a middle finger, instead of an index
            finger and the thumb seems to be half-drawn, rather than fully drawn. Although it may have both characters I
            requested in the image, it did not result in the way I expected with Mario and Luigi in the centre with
            Yoshi in the background and there are missing details or some deformed parts which left me disappointed.

        <p> Despite this, I am unable to compare both AI art generators as I did not experiment similarly (using
            different prompts and styles). However, you can see just from those two different AI art generators, that
            they still are not perfect as there are missing or incorrect details that ruin the image. It explained why
            numerous people preferred human artists creating artworks, not AI art as they are not perfect and would
            still require a human to edit to fix those minor issues.
