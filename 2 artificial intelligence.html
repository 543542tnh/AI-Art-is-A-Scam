        <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
        <p> To understand the content of artificial intelligence art, we would need to start from the basics, by asking
            ourselves what artificial intelligence is.

        <p>
            According to John McCarthy, AI (shortened for artificial intelligence) is “the science and engineering of
            making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of
            using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are
            biologically observable.” (IBM, no date, p. 1)

        <p>
            Machine learning is an algorithms-based AI program trained on the data. The data and experience that have
            been processed allowed the algorithms to identify patterns to predict and recommend to users. The efficacy
            of algorithms improved by adjusting themselves to new data and experience. As technology significantly
            progressed, there is a massive volume and complication of data that is difficult for humans to handle that
            increased potential and need for machine learning (Nichols, Herbert Chan and Baker, 2018; Janiesch, Zschech
            and Heinrich, 2021; IBM, no date).

        <p>
            There is a type of machine learning called ‘deep learning’ where it processes an expansive range of data
            resources (e.g. text) without a human’s assistance and can produce more accurate results than old machine
            learning could do. It used neural networks to consume and process data many times to learn the complex
            details of data. It also can make deductions about the data to find out if it is correct, allowing them to
            make new deductions about the new data based on what they have learnt from the previous data.

        <p>
            Machine learning uses three different types of neural networks that have their uses.

        <p> <b>Feed-Forward Neural Network </b> </p>
        <p>
            The first one is a ‘feed-forward neural network’. It is a simple network as it only moves the information
            forward from the input layer to the output layer. The process is quite straightforward as you place the data
            into the machine to train them to predict every possibility. It is often used in banking to detect fraud.

        <p> <b> Convolutional Neural Network </b> </p>
        A convolutional neural network (shortened as CNN) is a feed-forward neural network based on the animal visual
        cortex (the image processor). It is well-suitable for tasks related to identifying. It began with processing the
        provided image into a collection of pixels. It goes into the hidden layer to identify the unique features of the
        image. After identifying every aspect of the image, CNN is now able to classify any other images the same as the
        given image if it has the same features.

        <p> <b>Recurrent Neural Networks</b>
            Artificial neural networks called Recurrent neural networks focus on connections where the machine would put
            the data into a loop forward and backward as it goes through the layers. It is useful for prediction as
            every input along with previous inputs is automatically fed into the machine (McKinsey, 2023).

        <p>
            AI can be split into two groups: strong and weak. Weak is usually used for a simple task like being a
            personal assistant, for example, Apple’s Siri who answers any questions. Strong AI can perform a complicated
            task like a human carrying the task as they are designed to solve issues that may appear without a human’s
            assistance like self-driving cars (Investopedia, 2023).

        <p>
            The main purpose of AI art is to create a digital source to have easy access and collect all artworks
            (Cetinic and She, 2021). However, the purpose can vary depending on the creator. The most common purpose is
            growing the possibilities of technology and creativity as well as persuading people to include technology as
            part of their lives and creativity (Fotor, no date).

        <p>
            Those websites listed below are the most popular AI generators that enable you to produce AI art (although
            some may cost money to produce) (Zapier, no date).

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th><img src="Image/DALL E.jpg" style="width:40%"></th>
                <th><img src="Image/Images AI.jpg" style="width:40%"></th>
                <th><img src="Image/nightcafe-logo.png" style="width:40%"></th>
                <th><img src="Image/DreamStudio.webp" style="width:40%"></th>
                <th><img src="Image/Bing Image Creator.svg" style="width:60%"></th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td><i>Figure 3</i> DALL-E Logo <br>(Source: Zapier, 2023)</td>
                <td><i>Figure 4</i> Images.ai Logo <br>(Source: Zapier, 2023)</td>
                <td><i>Figure 5</i> NightCafe Logo <br>(Source: Zapier, 2023)</td>
                <td><i>Figure 6</i> DreamStudio Logo <br>(Source: Zapier, 2023)</td>
                <td><i>Figure 7</i> Bing Image Creator Logo <br>(Source: Zapier, 2023)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
        <p> The generator used the “text-to-image” method where the user types down words (or prompts) and selects
            options (usually art style or size), they visually want the image to look like. Then the computer will bind
            the prompts together along with the selected options to create AI art however they think it will look. The
            program is trained to collect and use existing artworks (posted art or provided art by the inventor) to
            teach themselves to distinguish between art styles and practices. Once they have learned everything from the
            given artworks, they will take in the knowledge and apply it to produce new artworks based on the style or
            techniques (Lang and Ommer, 2019).

        <p>
            In the last decades, online art collections increased due to the wide-ranging digitalisation efforts
            providing access for everyone to view the artworks located in numerous museums or art galleries around the
            world. The accessibility of gathering digital artworks initiated interdisciplinary research perspectives.
            The physical art and its digital version are encoded and linked to similar complicated structures of
            information despite being in dissimilar material modes. Just like how you can inspect background information
            from the painting that would be useful for an art historian, you are also able to inspect digital paintings
            containing undiscovered potential information.

        <p> The primary purpose of digitalised missions is normally granting access and discovery to massive collections
            of digital artworks. However, these collections are only a requirement at the beginning for applying
            advanced computational methods and new potential research (Cetinic and She, 2021).

        <p> 
            Here is a diagram to show the process of “art collections” from digitization to advanced computational
            analysis. It began by collecting many available art online or from the user’s imported art then the computer
            scanned the art into quantitative analysis, allowing the computer to measure. Then it obtained the
            information and visualisation through computation methods, (“adopt a distance viewing” or a “close reading
            approach”). At the end of the process, the results are collected which are used to improve the
            functionalities of sources and collections by increasing advanced methods of content discovery (Lang and
            Ommer, 2019).
        
        <p> 
            There are two ways to use the computational methods which are “adopt a distance viewing” or a “close reading
            approach”. Distance viewing inspects massive collections by focusing on one aspect or any similar features
            which enabled them to create statistical visualizations. Close reading is focused on one specific area of a
            certain work or art piece to address the issues (usually visual stylometry or computational artist
            authentication) (Cetinic and She, 2021).
