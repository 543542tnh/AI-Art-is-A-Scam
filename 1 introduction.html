        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In recent years artificial intelligence has become a key issue for the creative industry due to being seen
            as a threat to many designers and artists (Leslie, 2023).
        <p>
            Many see artificial intelligence as beneficial as it is effective and can mass-produce high-quality creative
            content giving designers and artists an easier time to focus on their jobs. (Paper Crane, no date) However,
            very few people realise the small extent of the ethical issues and the damaging effect on the creative
            industries with their jobs and lives. (Babbs, 2023).

        <p>
            I view artificial intelligence art as a scam because many people are blinded by the benefits, failing to see
            the ill intentions behind those artificial intelligence art generators and the potential damage they cause
            to them, and creative industries and it can go both sides. For example, a designer uses artificial
            intelligence as an outcome, tricking the clients into believing they receive original art. Or the client
            uses an artificial intelligence art generator to bypass artists and designers, unwilling to give them money.
            Furthermore, there is no clear boundary when it is acceptable to use artificial intelligence as a tool or as
            an outcome.
        <p>
            This essay will attempt to highlight how artificial intelligence is a threat to the creative industries and
            how acceptable it is to use artificial intelligence as a tool during the design process.

        <p>
            This essay will examine the definition of artificial intelligence and will show both sides of artificial
            intelligence art, benefits, and drawbacks with case studies to evident the points evident. It also
            investigates the boundary of using artificial intelligence as a tool or as an outcome and the potential that
            could come out of artificial intelligence. In conclusion, it will aim to answer the biggest question, is
            artificial intelligence art truly a scam?
