            With AI art’s popularity rising, it starts to cause issues, especially with artists. This news shows how
            frightening AI art is as it can deeply affect the artists as their opportunities have been stolen.

            </div>

        <p>
            A video game designer, Jason M. Allen is the very first person to win Colorado’s annual summer art fair’s
            digital art/digitally manipulated photography section with his AI art named “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial by
            MidJourney. He posted his victory online to only receive a lot of backlash (Magazine and Kuta, 2022).

        <p>
            “We’re watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes — if creative jobs aren’t safe from
            machines, then even high-skilled jobs are in danger of becoming obsolete. What will we have then?”
            (@OmniMorpho, 2022, p. 4).

        <p>
            “But A.I. art does seem like a thing that will devalue art in the long run” (Bors, 2022, p.12).

        <p>
            According to Allen, the intention behind his AI art is to make a statement to encourage people to discuss AI
            which he has accomplished. He may not have broken rules as he disclosed, he used MidJourney to the
            authorities and in the rulebook, there was no direct mention of AI art but is seen as the same as other
            digital programs (e.g. Photoshop), which enabled Allen to submit his piece via Midjourney. Witnessing AI art
            win the art fair under the excuse as “artistic practice that uses digital technology as part of the creative
            or presentation process.” (Per, 2022, p. 6), and hearing it would still win regardless of whether the
            judge’s knowledge about AI art. It has raised questions concerning what defines art and the job line in the
            creative industry (Magazine and Kuta, 2022).

        <p>
            “To developers and technically minded people, [A.I. is] this cool thing, but to illustrators, it’s very
            upsetting because it feels like you’ve eliminated the need to hire the illustrator,” (Bors, 2022, p.12).

        <p>
            On March 16th, 2023, the U.S. Copyright Office officially announced a new policy stating AI art cannot
            receive copyright claims due to no human involvement in the process. For the AI art to have copyrights, it
            would require the piece to be produced by the human with the AI as an assistant (U.S. Copyright Office,
            Library of Congress., 2023).

        <p>
            Jason Allen requested a copyright for his “Theatre D’opera Spatial” which has been rejected by the Copyright
            Office for this reason “the picture is not a product of human authorship.” He argued he was involved in
            creating the piece in the process as he input “at least 624” times to get the desired image and used Adobe
            Photoshop to edit the image to remove the flaws (Growcoot, 2023).

        <p>
            This implies AI art generator is still in the imperfect stage as it contains mistakes requiring the user to
            use another program to erase those mistakes. As well as the fact it takes Allen 624 tries to get the image,
            he wanted proven it is time-consuming and inconvenient, which are opposite of what people believed AI is.
            This goes to show it would be beneficial to commission a human artist or designer to design the piece you
            want which would come out in a high-quality image and you would not have to go through time-consuming and
            inefficient steps yourself as the designer/artist would handle those steps for you.
