        <h2>What Are The Benefits?</h2>
        <p>
            Strictly speaking AI, it has proven in other industries (e.g. healthcare industry) that it is efficient and
            effective. It would not be surprising to find out it has many useful benefits in creative industries as many
            artists who openly support technology use AI as a tool (for example using AI to generate ideas or as a
            reference) (Thumin, 2022).

        <p>
            X user, Peter Yang has given a few examples of ways to use AI to enhance artwork like generating a
            background or extending the border of your image, providing options for designers to choose from and adjust
            to their liking to coordinate with the centrepiece. Additionally, another method is working with AI to turn
            a sketch into a detailed art piece making it less time-consuming and less stressful for the designer as they
            do not worry about deadlines (Yang, 2022).

        <p>
            It’s the ability to produce art ranging from landscapes to shapes for the artists to use in their artwork
            making it less time-consuming. As well as the process sped up as AI provides colours and realistic textures.
            Not to mention parts will be automatically drawn giving them less work to draw (Ahmed, 2023).

        <p> When it comes to generating AI art, there are benefits to it which are free of charge and accessible. This
            meant anyone could use the generator which would not cost them anything to use the service. As well as it
            requires no skills to produce artwork as it only requires the user to input prompts for the computer to
            quickly generate an art piece.

        <p>
            Furthermore, it also can provide text and image descriptions (an image description is a small piece of
            information describing the image in detail (‘Guide to Image Descriptions – AccessiblePublishing.ca’, no
            date)) for blind and visually impaired people, giving them an easier time to enjoy and engage arts online
            without feeling restricted (NANOU, 2023).

        <p>
            As AI art expands and makes a significant impact in the creative industry, it opens a new opportunity for
            non-skilled and creative people to gain profit. A new job title is called AI artist. Due to how accessible
            and easy it is to use; many people take this opportunity to become AI artists.

        <p>
            There are a lot of AI artists who offer commissions ranging from the cheapest price of £5 to the expensive
            price of £300.

        <p>
            The process of commissioning the AI artist is simple and it is very similar to another type of commission.
            The client firstly commissions d the AI artist to produce an artwork based on their request. Then the AI
            artist would use an existing AI generator (for example, Midjourney) or their own AI generator and type down
            the prompts for the computer to generate the requested artwork. Once the artist selects the artwork, they
            believe it has met all criteria, they will give it to their client who then pays them for the artwork.

        <p>
            This is why I feel like the clients are getting scammed by the AI artist, as they are not producing the
            artwork themselves but, using AI who steal another artist’s artwork to generate an art piece.
