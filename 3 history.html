        <h2>How Did AI Art Start?</h2>
        <p>
            AI art dates to the 1970s when many AI art inventors; Harold Cohen, Arthur Elsenaar, Remko Scha, David Cope,
            Peter Beyls and Naoko Tosa have made their involvement in the AI art field (Understanding and creating art
            with ai: review and outlook, 2021). For example, Harold Cohen first developed an AI assistant named Aaron
            System in 1973. The Aaron system assisted Cohen in producing the very first AI black-and-white art piece
            using a symbolic AI method. (tech) It is not known in the computer art community due to the complications
            and the lack of AI systems during the period of 1970s and 1980s. Furthermore, the low research budget and
            declining interest also caused it to have one of its “winters” (The History of AI Art, 2023).

            <div class="reference"> <i> Figure 9 </i> Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy (Source: Obvious Art,

        <p> It resurfaced again in 2014 when the discussion of GANs (the foundation of generative AI technology) was
            brought up. Then a year later, in 2015, Google published a new technology called DeepDream, to approach the
            AI art by using convolutional neural networks to advance the field. A few years later in 2018, Ganbreeder
            who rebranded itself as Artbreeder used the GANs model to enable users to change and produce artworks with
            AI. Within the same year, Obvious (artist collector) sold a painting named “Edmond de Belamy” which was
            formed using a GANs model at Christie's auction house for $432,500. The GANs models read and learnt from
            WikiArt websites and published 15,000 portraits that were between the 14th and 19th centuries.
        
        <p>  
            Around January 2021, there was a huge interest and expanded imagination from GAN-based image generation
            (text-to-image). In the same month, OpenAI launched a new free and accessible system named Dall-E for anyone
            to use to create AI art by typing down prompts. In May 2022, Google released their own AI art generator
            called Imagen, another text-to-image generator as well another company, Stability AI also launched their AI
            art generator (GAN-based) Stable Diffusion’s service in August 2022 (Sergey, 2023).
        
        <p>   
            As AI art becomes increasingly popular and advanced, many software companies are joining, and new generators
            are being created in 2023 to the point it has made their solid root. In March 2023, Adobe announced their
            GAN-based Adobe Firefly service which will be incorporated with Adobe’s popular editing software (for
            example, Photoshop) (techtarget, no date).
